#  Kickstarting with Excel
## An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

### Overview of Project

####        Louise has a play called 'Fever' that is close to its fundraising goal. To assist Louise in her launch parameters additional analysis was done on other plays to help in her success. The data will show how launch date and funding goals can effect the outcomes of different campaigns in the plays category.

### Analysis and Challenges

### Results

#### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- The most successful Plays are launched between the months of April and May.
- The success of Plays launched declines in the last quarter of the year.
- The month of May not only signifies the decline of success but the highest time for failure, possibly because more Plays are launched in that period over any other.

#### Outcomes Based on Goals

- The most successful Plays had goals below $5000 or between $35,000-$40,000.
- Those most likely to fail had goals over $50,000 with goals at $25,000 to $30,000 coming in at a close 2nd.

#### Limitations of this dataset
- Data seemed to be heavily derived from the US and GB; so a comparable of successful launches in other countries is very limited.
- Currency in this analysis is blanketing all countries with the US$ so successful launches based on goals and donationa is skewed since not all currency is equal to the US$.
- Genre of the Plays is not in the dataset and could offer a drill down on specifics to which category of Plays are most successful in Theater.
