#  Kickstarting with Excel
## An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

### Overview of Project

#### Louise has a play that is close to its fundraising goal. To assist her in a successful launch additional analysis was done on other Plays. The analysis will show how launch dates and funding goals can effect the outcomes of different campaigns that fall in the Plays category.


### Analysis and Challenges

#### Kickstarter campaign data was used in this report. Five formulated columns were added to the raw data in order to extract the data points needed for analysis (columns with formulas have a 'blue' fill in their header). Pivot tables and charts were created to present a clear picture of those points of interest for the Client.  

#### There weren't any challenges presented in the manipulation of the data. But lack of familiarity with writing formulas, creating and using pivot tables and charts, in excel, could present a challenge in manipulating the data for your needs. Although, challenges could be presented by way of outliers that can skew the data (ie. campaign goals of $1.00 in the success category) and in the limitations of data should the Client require other knowledge for their success that isn't represented in your data (ie. more Plays from other countries). 


### Results

#### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- The most successful Plays are launched between the months of April and May.
- The success of Plays launched declines in the last quarter of the year.
- The month of May not only signifies the decline of success but the highest time for failure, possibly because more Plays are launched in that period over any other.

#### Outcomes Based on Goals

- The most successful Plays had goals below $5000 or between $35,000-$40,000.
- Those most likely to fail had goals over $50,000 with goals at $25,000 to $30,000 coming in at a close 2nd.

#### Limitations of this dataset
- Data seemed to be heavily derived from the US and GB; so a comparable of successful launches in other countries is very limited.
- Currency in this analysis is blanketing all countries with the US$ so successful launches based on goals and donationa is skewed since not all currency is equal to the US$.
- Genre of the Plays is not in the dataset and could offer a drill down on specifics to which category of Plays are most successful in Theater.

#### Other possible tables and/or graphs
- Success in Launch Location
- Most Successful Play Genres
